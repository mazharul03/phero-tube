        <div class="w-11/12 mx-auto my-12">

            <li class="font-bold text-2xl">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const :</li>

            <h3 class="underline text-center font-semibold my-6 text-xl">Scope of Var</h3>

            <P class="text-lg">Scope basically refers to the area in which these variables can be used. Var
                declarations
                can be
                function/locally or
                globally scoped.

                When a var variable is declared outside of a function, the scope is global. This means that any variable
                declared
                outside of a function block using the var keyword is accessible throughout the entire window.

                When a variable is declared inside a function, it has function scope. This indicates that it is
                accessible
                and
                limited to that function.
            </p>

            <h3 class="underline font-semibold my-6 text-center text-xl">Scope of Let</h3>

            <p class="text-lg">A block is a section of code that is bounded by. Curly braces house a block. A block is
                anything
                contained in curly brackets.

                Consequently, a variable declared in a block with let can only be used in that block. </p>

            <h3 class="underline font-semibold my-6 text-center text-xl">Scope of Const</h3>

            <p class="text-lg">Constant values are kept for variables specified using the const keyword. Let
                declarations and const
                declarations have some similarities.

                The scope of const declarations is blocked.

                Const declarations, like let declarations are only accessible within the block in which they were made.

                It is impossible to modify or re-declare const.

                This indicates that within the scope of a variable declared with const, its value will not change. It
                cannot be changed or declared again. </p>

        </div>


        <div class="w-11/12 mx-auto my-12">

            <li class="font-bold text-2xl">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined :</li>

            <h3 class="underline font-semibold my-5 text-center text-xl">Null</h3>

            <P class="text-lg">
                Null is used to represent an intentional absence of value. It represents a variable whose value is
                undefined. It accepts only one value, which is null. The Null keyword is used to define the Null type in
                TypeScript, but it is not useful because we can only assign a null value to it.
            </p>

            <h3 class="underline font-semibold my-6 text-center text-xl">Undefined</h3>

            <P class="text-lg">
                It represents uninitialized variables in TypeScript and JavaScript. It has only one value, which is
                undefined. The undefined keyword defines the undefined type in TypeScript, but it is not useful because
                we can only assign an undefined value to it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-11/12 mx-auto my-12">

            <li class="font-bold text-2xl">What do you mean by REST API ?</li>

            <h3 class="underline font-semibold my-6 text-center text-xl">What is an API?</h3>

            <P class="text-lg">Since we're talking about REST APIs, our definition of an API will not go beyond the
                scope of the web.

                API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API establishes a connection between programs so
                they can transfer data.

                A program that has an API implies that some parts of its data is exposed for the client to use. The
                client could be the frontend of the same program or an external program.

                In order to get this data, a structured request has to be sent to the API. If the request meets the
                desired requirements, a response which contains the data gets sent back to where the request was made.
                This response usually comes in the form of JSON or XML data.

                In some cases, you'll need some sort of authorization to gain access to external API data.

                Every API has documentation that tells you what data is available and how to structure your request in
                order to get a valid response.
            </p>

            <h3 class="underline font-semibold my-6 text-center text-xl">What is REST?</h3>

            <p class="text-lg">
                REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is a standard that guides the design and development
                of processes which enable us interact with data stored on a web servers.

                The above definition may not look as complex or "professional" as the ones you come across on the
                internet, but the goal here is for you to understand the basic purpose of REST APIs.

                An API that complies with some or all of the six guiding constraints of REST is considered to be
                RESTful.

                We are able to communicate with servers using the HTTP protocol. With these protocols, we can Create,
                Read, Update and Delete data â€“ otherwise known as CRUD operations.

                But how can we perform these CRUD operations and communicate with data on the server?

                We can do this by sending HTTP requests, and that is where REST comes in. REST simplifies the
                communication process by providing various HTTP methods/operations/verbs which we can use to send
                requests to the server.
